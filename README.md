## What ShipIt! does?
ShipIt! looks to become a decentralized sharing economy platform that combines the growing trend of peer-to-peer businesses with the delivery industry. Through a web application, ShipIt! connects Receivers, those who would like to have an item delivered, with Shippers who happen to be going along that route and have extra space in their vehicles or their trunks. From a business standpoint, a distinct advantage that ShipIt! has over traditional incumbents lies in its ability to maximize economic efficiency. The platform provides value to customers who now have a reliable and low-cost alternative for deliveries, as well as commuters who are able to cut down or recoup the cost of gas for a journey they were planning on regardless.

## How does the blockchain come into play?
All data concerning delivery transactions are stored on the Ethereum blockchain network. Decentralization allows us to further maximize economic efficiency by replacing any intermediaries with smart contracts established directly between parties (Shipper and Receiver). This is unlike services like Uber and Airbnb, which take a cut of the payment from the user of the service to the provider to compensate them for facilitating the transaction. We believe this reinforces our mission for creating positive change in a non-profit manner.
